Quick announcement here at the outset.
0:05
Please make sure that you are watching the due dates of the guest speaker right up your financial statement analysis right up.
0:10
And if you have missed class and you have to turn in the one page write up for classes missed if you went
0:20
over the allowable amount that three page write up for class classes miss all of that is due at 11:59 p.m.
0:30
That's just before midnight on March 17th, which is a Friday this coming Friday, so just days away.
0:39
So please make sure that you're getting everything in because we have to go to grade and
0:45
we're not going to be able to extend any of the time because that's about the last,
0:51
you know, that will just give us enough time to submit the grades on time, etc.
0:56
Okay. Any question on that? Okay.
1:00
I'm so game plan for today is to see if we can get through our last couple of chapters of material.
1:06
But every now and then, I guess news events do actually impact, you know, real world events kind of impact academic studies and went on,
1:11
I guess we've had one which is this Silicon Valley bank now, I guess having pretty significant financial problems.
1:25
And it looks like the federal government's going to have to bail them out.
1:34
And it looks like at least the president said this morning that he would be willing to insure
1:39
deposits in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's minute hour maximum of 250,000.
1:45
He's saying [INAUDIBLE] try to honor those greater than that.
1:55
But of course, the way politics are, you got one side pulling one way, one side pulling the other.
1:59
It looks like the president could have problems with some individuals in his own party that,
2:05
you know, don't think that it's okay to bail out millionaires or billionaires, whatever,
2:10
when, in fact, you know, there's folks that are little further down the financial food chain that are suffering and yet,
2:15
you know, there's some resistance to help those folks. Anyway, I did a little bit of looking at this.
2:21
And admittedly, guys, this was coming off of, you know, think they think that thing got announced Friday and what happened or Saturday or something.
2:28
And we were talking you know, I have my family over this weekend and I'm trying to, you know,
2:36
tell my brother not to pop his car in my planter box and all that kind of stuff, you know.
2:42
So just this morning, hearing couple little things and some of the things, some of the rumblings that are starting up,
2:48
I thought, well, accounting and what the FSB says actually is having an impact on this particular thing.
2:55
And it was a particular subject that I said was beyond the scope of this class,
3:04
it suddenly kind of maybe is not so outside of the scope of this class,
3:07
as I had originally thought it was, you know, not knowing that this thing was brewing.
3:11
So what I'm going to do is kind of go back a little bit to more of the financial reporting discussions
3:17
that we had had earlier and go back to this idea of something called other comprehensive income.
3:22
Okay. Now we've studied net income. We know that revenue minus expenses equals net income.
3:30
But some years back, users of financial reports went to the FSB and said,
3:36
Can you show us how different things that don't necessarily affect net income, affect stockholders equity?
3:43
And so FAS, we came up with this idea of something called other comprehensive income.
3:50
And what other comprehensive income does is take net income and adjusted for
3:57
things that they're saying don't fairly fit into the definition net income.
4:02
Yet if they did, this is how they would affect net income and we call that other comprehensive income.
4:07
And you can kind of see, just from what I'm telling you right now, why I've sort of avoided that a little bit.
4:14
It's a little wonky, right. But let's go ahead.
4:20
And I think with a little bit of understanding and again,
4:23
the reason I pushed you so hard with journal entries is everything gets communicated through journal entries.
4:26
And that's what I'm going to do right now because we talk about this.
4:31
So let's say a company has cash, okay?
4:34
And they have cash of $150, whatever.
4:40
Just to keep the numbers simple. And let's say all of that cash is constituted of money.
4:43
They've earned retained earnings, 150,000 does a balance sheet balance.
4:49
And okay, that's their balance sheet. They've got some cash amount or 50.
4:55
Must come in through some net income and they're showing 150,000 in their retained earnings.
4:59
Now, let's say that the company takes some of that money and they buy a bond investment and they buy a bond investment of $100.
5:04
So now just looking at the balance sheet immediately after that transaction, the cash would, of course, be $50.
5:14
They have what? Bond investment of $100.
5:23
And can the retained earnings is $150.
5:31
So far, so good. Now what happens?
5:36
Let's say that this bond is considered what they call an available for sale security.
5:40
What FSB allows companies to do is categorize their securities into trading.
5:47
When I say securities, this does not apply to stocks. This applies to debt, securities like bonds.
5:55
They can put them in what they call trading. They can put them in what they call available for sale.
6:01
Or they can put them into what they call held to maturity.
6:08
Okay. Now, if they put the security into trading securities,
6:18
what they do is on the balance sheet they mark to market and any unrealized gains or losses go straight to the income statement.
6:23
In other words, if the security lost value, we would report a decrease in the value.
6:44
We'd credit the security on the balance sheet, we'd debit a loss.
6:50
And that loss would go into the calculation of net income and would show right there on the income statement with available for sale securities,
6:54
Phase B says, well, we still want you on the balance sheet to mark to market.
7:01
So that's the same as what we see for the trading securities.
7:10
But unrealized holding gains and losses will allow you to report that is something called other comprehensive income.
7:15
And what we're going to do is we're going to let you report it is sort of something different than net income.
7:30
We're going to let you put that on a different statement other than your income statement.
7:36
And then if you have the positive intent and ability to hold the security to maturity, forget all of this.
7:43
You don't have to report unrealized gains and losses on the balance sheet.
7:50
You don't market to market. There is no generation of a calculation of gain or loss on changes in value of that security.
7:54
Now, a trading security is something that is traded on a daily basis.
8:03
That's the term traded. The held a maturity means the entity has the positive intent and ability to hold that, say, five year bond until it matures.
8:07
The available for sale says you're not in either category neither or you're not in trading.
8:18
You're not in held to maturity. You're in available for sale market to market on the balance sheet.
8:24
But we won't make it affect your net income number.
8:32
And I've talked in here several times about my concern that, you know,
8:35
sometimes investors and whatnot are a little bit obsessed with net income as a measure to the value of a company.
8:39
But we've got to deal with this and fast.
8:47
We've got to deal with them. They don't want to upset the net income, so they come up with this thing called other comprehensive income,
8:50
which people kind of half ass understand, to be honest with you.
8:56
Okay, so what happens?
9:01
We go ahead and we have this security and let's say the only transaction that happens and they've called this and available for sale security,
9:04
this bond investment of 100 they've decided it's an available for sale security.
9:13
And let's say that the value of that security drops from 100 to 40.
9:17
Okay. Pretty significant drop right now to bring this bond investment down to 40.
9:24
What journal entry should I make? Okay.
9:32
Just to just talk to me about the asset account bond investment with the seven DSD account.
9:38
Okay. I have an asset and I want to decrease it from 100 to 40.
9:44
What should I do to it? Okay, good. That's right. So I'm going to go ahead and make credit the investment.
9:50
Bond investment. Right. Just call it what it is. Bond investment.
9:58
I'm going to credit it for what do we say? It's going to got got to come down to 40.
10:02
So I'm going to credit it for 60. I have to debit something and I'll debit loss on investments and I'll debit that for 60.
10:07
When I do, what happens? Then I can prepare my.
10:21
Oh sorry I'll have to debit unrealized lost.
10:26
Unrealized loss on bond investment. And I'm going to hyphen that with other comprehensive income, because this is a held in maturity security.
10:36
Now, when I prepare my income statement, if this was the only transaction that happened, do I have any revenue?
10:45
Revenue is zero. Do I have any expenses? Expenses?
10:55
Zero. Do I have any losses? And the answer is no, not on the income statement.
11:02
Because if it's a available for sale security, I don't have to report that loss on the income statement.
11:10
So my loss is what, zero my net income is therefore what zero?
11:16
Then I prepare another statement and I prepare another statement called Comprehensive Income.
11:28
And with my statement of comprehensive income. With my statement of comprehensive income.
11:39
I start with net income. Which was zero.
11:48
And then I subtract unrealized loss on available for sale security.
11:56
OCI. This is something that's called other comprehensive income.
12:07
I report what the 60 loss and now my comprehensive income or comprehensive loss I guess is 60, isn't it?
12:13
But you got to go to a separate statement to find this other comprehensive loss for the period and see that my other comprehensive income is 60.
12:34
Now, what'll happen since nothing.
12:44
How do we calculate net income, beginning balance, add net income which is zero minus dividends which is zero.
12:48
Retained earnings is still what retained earnings is still no.
12:55
Retained earnings is still what when 57 retained earnings beginning balance.
13:01
Plus net income minus dividends equals ending balance.
13:10
And my net income was zero, wasn't it? So the retained earnings is still what is still 150.
13:15
The cash is still 50, but the bond investment is what it was 100.
13:22
Now it's what we credited for 60.
13:40
So now it's 40. So the bond investment is 40.
13:43
Why are you guys looking at this t account like I just pulled out of alien out of my ass.
13:48
This isn't 100. I credit it for 60. It's now, what, 40?
13:54
Okay, good. So the bond investment is what? Bond investment is 40.
13:59
Does a balance sheet balance. Does a balance sheet balance.
14:09
Does this balance sheet balance right now? What do I need to make it?
14:15
Balance. Loss? I need what?
14:21
I need a6d down here in the stockholders equity, a -60 and that -66 something called accumulated other comprehensive income.
14:24
And the only comprehensive income item I've had so far that we've talked about is this loss of 60.
14:36
So that's going to cause that what to be a -60.
14:43
Does the balance sheet balance now is a balance sheet balance now?
14:48
Okay. Now, what happened if you were to take a look at.
14:53
Some of the financial reports of SBC.
15:01
Remember the 10-K. And if you were to go ahead and look at their financial statements and I'll start with the consolidated balance sheet.
15:06
So what I want to start with. Yeah, okay.
15:17
I'll start with the consolidated balance sheet and you come over and you take a look at this
15:21
thing called accumulated other comprehensive income that I just sort of gave you a brief,
15:28
little brief discussion on. Okay. Notice that went from what, a negative nine.
15:34
I don't know how many zeros they add to this, but then number what shot up, didn't it, between 2022 and 2023.
15:41
Okay. So what that statement was telling you went from 9 to 911, maybe they were trying to tell you some 911.
15:50
Be careful. Okay. So we saw that it basically went up.
15:59
And when you came over to the income statement and you saw what you saw the net income number that everybody's obsessed with.
16:03
You saw this net income number of about 1609, which is a positive number.
16:15
But then if you kept going and you looked at the statement of comprehensive income,
16:22
well, then you saw that things weren't so pretty because what they had this.
16:29
2503 unrealized.
16:36
Los. Showing on the same comprehensive income.
16:42
In other words, hey, something's happening here.
16:47
We've got some available for sale securities that apparently ain't doing too well.
16:50
And so when you came down to it, they said what you really have when you look at comprehensive income is a -230,
16:57
not so much that nice positive number that you saw a minute ago.
17:05
Right now, I think and again, guys, a lot of this is there's probably more detail out there already about this.
17:09
But just from what I'm starting to hear, apparently for some reason, in 92, in 2019,
17:18
the federal government decided that when they look at banks and they regulate banks and banks are regulated.
17:28
You've heard of the FDIC, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, you've heard of the Office of Comptroller of the Currency,
17:34
which also is a regulator, came together and for some reason in 2019, under a different administration came forward and said,
17:41
when you file your regulatory reports and you start to figure out your capital and they have different levels of capital,
17:50
but there's something called a tier one level of capital, which is like the basic safety and soundness that they look at at a bank.
17:58
You know, that's silly. Other comprehensive income, accumulated other comprehensive income.
18:06
We're going to let you add that back. It's okay. Add that back in determining your equity.
18:11
Just add it back. Don't worry about it. I mean, they probably didn't say quite like that.
18:16
They probably had some rules as to how you're supposed to do that.
18:20
So when I saw it and I saw them talking about that part, I went and looked at some of the regulatory filings of SBC.
18:23
And here's that negative other accumulated other comprehensive income, you know,
18:35
for those silly Phase B reportings that we've been going on and on about this class.
18:40
There it is. And then you come down and they have this number 12, three, five, eight,
18:46
and they have this number, which is this 313, six, nine seven, which is a larger number.
18:53
And what happens is they start making all of these adjustments.
19:00
And it is true that the difference between this number and this number is that difference of 13 three nine.
19:04
However, you know, unless my calculator was smoking crack over the weekend, I can't get these numbers here to reconcile to that number.
19:12
And don't ask me why. Okay.
19:22
There's a song by the Eagles says, I can't tell you why.
19:26
I can't tell you why. And it keeps going higher and higher.
19:30
And that was me sitting in the coffee area today. So I can't tell you why it is won't reconcile, but it doesn't.
19:34
Okay. But when you sit here and notice what they did and the other thing that's weird is this is a subtract up here,
19:42
whereas down here it's an A parentheses is an ad and I can't figure that out either.
19:50
Why they're using different way of displaying what they're trying to do in terms of add and subtract.
19:56
Sounds like they're f in with you, though. Okay, but then what I thought what they did is they took what this 1911,
20:02
which is a subtract and they added back almost all of it in determining what their tier one capital was.
20:10
And I don't know enough about federal banking law and whatnot,
20:19
and to tell you how that then would influence the decisions of those that are responsible for saying, okay, well,
20:24
now we're able to make these different investments and make these different investment
20:32
decisions because we don't have to we're not as restricted by this tier one capital.
20:37
So I don't know how that signaled to them that there was going to be a ability to do certain different things that they wouldn't have done otherwise.
20:41
All I can tell you is the way if this is December 31st, 2022, and we're here, what, march?
20:49
We're not even through the first quarter of 2023. For some reason, the federal government decided to pull back on that.
20:56
And now we're hearing, oh, we need to bolster our balance sheet, blah, blah, blah.
21:04
And apparently what this did now was cause some sort of run on SBC.
21:10
And I think that there were literally people lined up outside the bank now.
21:16
And so now you starting to combine what this sort of softening of some of the rules,
21:20
combined with misunderstanding of what it all means, combined with what something that comes out.
21:26
And now the whole Neanderthal part of things is starting to potentially have some kind of effect.
21:32
That's why I tell you, you know, in here, I keep saying that when they say we're going to put rules in place so this will never happen again.
21:40
I tell you, look out when they say that.
21:50
They're going to figure out a way to mess around with that.
21:55
And it's going to happen again. And I don't know if it's going to be as bad as we saw in 2009, but it's certainly a good time.
22:00
So that's just I felt compelled to talk a little bit about that.
22:10
And again, I don't you know, I'm not an expert in banking, accounting or regulatory issues.
22:14
And there's all kinds of things that go on in there, I'm sure, in that space.
22:20
But the bottom line is the accounting rules do have an impact.
22:24
Right. And whether or not and how they're used and how they impact certain business decisions.
22:28
QUESTION Okay.
22:35
All right. That's enough of that. So let's just go ahead and go back to the game plan,
22:39
since I can see you're all just sit elated with that whole discussion and let's get into the last couple of slides we have left, okay?
22:43
All right. So let's take a look. And last time we talked about budgeting and when we talked about budgeting, last time, I forgot my notes.
22:53
Okay. When we talked about budgeting last time, I sort of pointed to this notion of, well, you can set a budget at a certain level of activity.
23:16
And then if that level of activity changes, all of a sudden you're looking saying, well,
23:28
how do I use the budget that assumed I was going to produce 50,000 units and instead I produce 60,000 units?
23:32
How will I use that budget that assumed 50,000?
23:39
So when we're looking at these budgets,
23:43
we're going to want to do a variance analysis and they say begin and I'm not sure where you're supposed to begin.
23:46
Here you have the budget, you perform and then you compare against the budget, right?
23:53
And when you compare against the budget, you're going to see, well, why was there something different from the budget?
23:58
What questions is that raise about my operations?
24:04
What are the causes? What actions can I take to address the fact that I didn't perform necessarily within my budget constraints?
24:07
And you go ahead, you make the adjustments, conduct, and this is an ongoing process as you try to move into some sort of continuous improvement.
24:16
And as Danny alluded last time,
24:24
it also can affect whatever your projections are and as analysts start to watch how you're performing against your projections.
24:26
Right. So you come over and what you can do is prepare a flexible budget.
24:32
And they're sort of showing this apples and oranges here because they're saying, well, look, I prepared my budget, assuming this level of activity.
24:39
Meanwhile, my level of activity was more or less than I expected.
24:46
So how can I adjust my budget to be able to address these potential changes in the actual activity?
24:49
So what we do is we prepare something called a flexible budget and the flexible budget
24:59
will allow us to compare more apples to apples as the level of activity changes.
25:04
So we've got this silly little example. There's Larry's lawn services and he sets up the budget and he sets up the budget, assuming that, you know,
25:09
he's going to mow 500 lawns and the lawns are all the same size, which is probably not realistic.
25:20
But, you know, this is just sort of a basic discussion and we're trying to just get a handle on, you know,
25:27
let's say all the lawns is the same so you can sort of see how we would address this flexible budget.
25:34
Okay. So he's going to charge, what, 75 bucks per lawn and then he's got his wages.
25:39
There's some variable component. Gasoline is pretty much variable, right?
25:46
How many more lawns you mow, the more gas you need, etc.
25:50
Okay. And so he's thinking you have an operating income of a $5,000.
25:54
So the actual results though differ because he mowed more lawns, he made more money and more and more lawns.
25:59
But we really don't know. Well, so was he spending more money on anything?
26:06
Was he able to charge a little more for the lawns? Then when you take a look at this, you start seeing these variances.
26:13
But this variance is being these variances are being driven significantly by the fact that we're trying to compare two different levels of activity,
26:20
the apple and orange analogy again. Right. So a way to handle this quandary, which is represented by this guy is to prepare a flexible budget.
26:29
And with the flexible budget, you say, well, we're going to adjust the budget for different levels of activity.
26:42
And then we can compare apples to apples and we say, Well, okay,
26:47
what if the budget would have anticipated this 550 lawns, which is what we actually mowed.
26:51
So we're going to go ahead and we're going to see now how we can compare the budget once we consider the different levels of activity.
26:57
So these activity variances are shown here.
27:09
Again, not very meaningful for us.
27:12
What we want to get to is what are the spending variances, the revenue variance, and then we're probably more interested in the spending variances.
27:15
So we come over and we go ahead and what we do is we adjust our budget now.
27:25
Well, what if he mowed 550 lawns?
27:33
What should have happened? So what we're supposed to spend said receive revenue of $75 per lawn 75.
27:36
Somebody check the math times five. 50 is how much? For the budget.
27:44
75 times. Five fifties. How much? More than 41000 to 50.
27:52
So everything in that. What flexible budget column is anticipating that we've mowed, what, 550 lawns now.
28:00
Now, when we look at the actual results, the actual results are saying, well, even when both are at 550, we still had variances, didn't we?
28:10
So the revenue is not what is not 41 to 50.
28:22
It's 43,000, isn't it? What's 43,000 divided by five?
28:27
50. 43,000.
28:33
What is it? What's the number? What's the number?
28:45
43,000 even? Yeah.
28:49
43,000 divided by 550.
28:53
What does that give us? 78.18. 78.18.
28:58
Why isn't it 75? Maybe some people that pay more to the hospital loans or whatever.
29:05
Yeah. No, all the loans are the same size.
29:13
Don't start telling me about bigger loans. Although loans are the same size, that was the assumption.
29:17
Okay, so once we understand that what's going on, some people have higher willingness to pay, huh?
29:22
Some people that have higher willingness to pay when they when when the guy knocks on the door and says, can you pay?
29:29
They say, how much is 75? Here, take 78.
29:36
Don't worry about it. Well, the tips you think they're going to report?
29:40
The tips you think your employees are going to come in and say, guess what?
29:43
I got extra money here. Maybe like your equipment, costumes.
29:46
Well, why would that cause me to generate more revenue? Why would a cost in my equipment cause me to generate more revenue?
29:52
Any thoughts? I don't know.
30:05
But you're getting a sense of what's going on here. Now we've got something to talk about, don't we?
30:09
How is it that we were able to generate 7818 instead of 75?
30:14
So you have a meeting amongst your, you know, field team and you say, what's going on?
30:19
And someone says, Well, what I did was I stopped at the door after I was done.
30:25
The person shaking because they're not sure if they're in trouble.
30:30
After I was done and I asked Mrs. Feeney if she wanted me to trim her rose bushes because they were looking a little a little shabby.
30:33
And she said, okay. And so I went ahead and just a little bit more.
30:42
Oh, we're able to raise, well, more revenue.
30:47
If after we're done, we go back, say do the little customer service thing instead of just taking off and throwing
30:51
out some in the back of the truck and getting the [INAUDIBLE] out of there, we stop. Do a little courtesy, we finish.
30:58
Oh, I noticed the bus did it, but. And we can maybe sell more services by having an interaction with the customer.
31:03
Everyone do that from now on. Goes into the pipe.
31:11
We do it. Maybe next time our revenue goes down and we're thinking, okay, well, that's not a good idea.
31:17
Apparently we pay as more people up than we are able to, you know, get happy.
31:22
But whatever. All right, good. Let's look at the gasoline.
31:27
The gasoline at 550 lawns, 550 times $9 per lawn should be 4950, shouldn't it?
31:31
Is that what it's supposed to be? But instead, when we take the number that's here, which is what's the number now?
31:40
How much if you. 5100.
31:53
Good. And we divide that by the 550 lawns that we mowed.
32:00
What do we get? 9.70 $9.27.
32:05
What happened? Why is it charging?
32:17
Why are we incurring $9.27? Could be more along the same lines.
32:22
550 lines. Same size lines.
32:29
Gas prices vary. Maybe gas prices went up and maybe we could.
32:38
Explain that difference that way. Maybe. Maybe.
32:46
Anything else could happen. Let's say grass, gas prices didn't go up.
32:51
Maybe grass prices went up. You know, you go over to the marijuana dispensary and they're charging more.
32:57
But gas prices have stayed the same, let's say. Now, what you're spending a lot more is when it's not actually cutting, you're running the lawnmower.
33:03
When it's not actually cutting. Yeah. You got some guy that, you know, he just is, like, turned on by lawn mower fumes.
33:13
Right. And he just let it run into his ankle. Okay.
33:19
That might be a cause. Maybe some of our own.
33:26
I'm just saying, some of our employees do this when they're supposed to fill up the lawnmower tank.
33:33
They also take the nozzle over and put a few gallons in their personal vehicle the same time,
33:40
which they're not supposed to do that necessarily, let's say. Right.
33:47
Okay. Whatever.
33:50
We start having some discussion about why maybe everyone's supposed to go, you guys have a rotten Robbie out here, or is that only in Hayward?
33:53
Okay, maybe instead of going to rotten Robbie, which is a cheap gas station, you know, they don't want to try to find a rotten Robbie.
34:03
So they go over to. Chevron or some more expensive gas station and go ahead and fill up the glamorous gas tank there.
34:10
So we remind everybody, hey, Rob and Robbie. If people are filling up their tanks, we remind the policy is, guys,
34:20
you are not to use the bank card for you know that we've given you to fill up the gas tank to fill up the the lawnmower tank.
34:30
Don't fill up your own personal gas tank with that. Don't forget, we emphasize that policy again.
34:40
Right. As an auditor, I am required when I start an audit,
34:45
I am required to do a variance analysis of various material accounts to see if something is coming out of balance.
34:53
It's looking weird. And again, I would use a materiality.
35:02
I don't know that I'd be worrying about $0.27 or whatever the difference is here.
35:05
But if I'm looking at two accounts, say, from last year to this year,
35:08
and I see this huge difference that tells the auditor there's where you need to be spending audit
35:12
resources because something is weird and the standards require that I do that and the standards require
35:18
then that I respond accordingly to that weird variance and start to be able to explain what procedures
35:24
I did to help me to identify any misstatements that might be associated with that variance.
35:30
Okay. So when we look at these and when you looked at this one,
35:36
we thought maybe we're using too much gas pearls on the guy who's sitting there letting the lawnmower run and smelling the fumes.
35:41
Or maybe we're going to Chevron instead of Rotten.
35:53
Robbie Or maybe what? People are sitting there and they're using too many gallons of gas, not because they're letting the lawnmower run,
35:56
but because they're filling up their own tank and putting it down as a legitimate use of gas to mow the lawns.
36:05
Right. But we don't really know from this analysis, do we know.
36:10
So the activity variances only give you excuse me, the spending variances only tell you so much about that spending.
36:15
So what we want to do is be able to break that spending.
36:27
This one was revenue. This spending is break that spending into whether it is constituting of price or quantity issues.
36:31
And so you can start to break these in to their price or quantity issues by looking at, well, what was the standard?
36:43
What were we supposed to spend for a price for? And you can break it into versus the quantity and you could break it into whether it is materials,
36:52
whether it is labor or whether it is an overhead component.
37:03
So we're going to just take a look at those three variances now, materials versus labor versus overhead.
37:07
And we're going to break them into their price component versus their quantity component.
37:15
Okay. So we start to take a look in.
37:22
I probably should have clicked each time labor please edit that later so that my voice matches with the advance here the slides,
37:24
who materials labor or what overhead.
37:33
Okay. Okay, good. So let's just go ahead and see how we're going to and I always seem to have way too many of this just slides in here again.
37:36
That's a price. And what quantity, right? That's where we're going.
37:45
Okay. So let's go ahead with materials first and we're going to use this little example here of this company that's
37:49
making parkas and they have the actual results and they're going to compare that to what their standard was.
37:59
Their standard budget was. But they're going to look at this in terms of quantity versus price.
38:06
Now, there are a lot of things you see in literature about how to calculate these price and quantity variances.
38:14
And I'm here to tell you that this is the way to do it. The way I do it is the way to do it.
38:21
And you may run into a different way that somebody wants to look at this, but I like to do it this way.
38:27
So to get my price variance,
38:33
I will need to take the actual quantity and I will multiply that by the difference between the standard price and the actual price.
38:35
That's for my price variance. Now the reason I put the standard first in the parentheses is that if the number is positive,
38:56
that means I spent what less than what I had budgeted for.
39:04
If the what number comes out negative, that means I spent what more and I like to look at it that positive is good.
39:09
Favorable negative is why unfavorable. So I go ahead and I.
39:17
Start to look at this thing and they say, well, you're supposed to use and they tell us.
39:24
Point two kilograms of fiber fill per park at $5 per kilogram.
39:31
What you actually use your actual quantity was what, 210 kilograms.
39:40
So I'm going to do what I'm going to say, 2/10.
39:47
They tell me I was supposed to spend, what, $5 per kilogram?
39:51
That's what I had budgeted for. So I put the, what, $5 in?
39:57
It's my standard price.
40:02
And they tell me that I actually spent what I actually spent $1,029 and I spent $1,029 to purchase and use, what, 210 kilograms of this fiber stuff.
40:04
And so when I go ahead and I do the math here, 210 kilograms divided by the $1,029.
40:26
What's my actual price? How much was good?
40:35
$4.90. That's what 210 times a ten cent difference.
40:45
Is that number negative or positive? This number negative or positive?
40:53
That's a positive number. That gives me, what, $0.10 times 210?
40:58
That gives me $21. Is it favorable or unfavorable?
41:05
It's favorable. F is favorable here because what I'm sitting there and I'm spending less per kilogram than I had budgeted for.
41:10
So I know I got a good price situation going on. How about my quantity?
41:21
So now I go ahead and I do my analysis for the quantity and you can see I sort of,
41:25
you know, give you this little thing down here for quantity variance.
41:32
And quantity variance is what, standard price?
41:36
And then I multiply that by the difference between what the standard quantity versus actual quantity.
41:48
Now again, guys, I put the standard first inside the parentheses because if the number comes out, what negative?
42:04
I want to know what that what that is unfavorable. If it's negative, it's positive.
42:11
It's favorable. Now, the standard price is what?
42:14
$5, the actual quantity.
42:20
How much should they actually use in this example?
42:25
Huh? 210 kilograms.
42:30
How much were they supposed to use?
42:39
Well, if they tell me that they made 2000 parkas and they tell me that they were supposed to use what point one kilogram of fiber filled per parka.
42:42
Point one times 2000 gives me what, 200.
42:57
So they used, what, 210 when they were supposed to use 200 to make these many parkas weren't they.
43:06
So five times in negative ten.
43:14
Gives me what -50. -50 is what.
43:18
Unfavorable.
43:24
Now, maybe not real important, guys, but I'm going to go ahead and just give you a little bit of a reasoning as to why we do things this way here,
43:28
where we're just trying to get, well, what is the effect of using too much or too little of the I mean, what is the effect of the price here?
43:41
We do what we use the actual quantity so we can amplify the effect of the difference in price.
43:50
Here we're trying to just figure out what well, what's the effect of the difference in quantity.
43:58
And we don't want to distort that with any price information.
44:04
So we use well, we use a standard price to sort of hold that constant.
44:08
That's why we do it the way we do it. But now we know that, hey, we use too much, but we didn't pay as much for this stuff.
44:14
Okay, well, what should we do differently then? We're using too much stuff, but we're getting a pretty good price for it.
44:24
What should we do? Would you want to do?
44:32
So that's the. Oh, this is just a proof. I should probably take this out.
44:42
The book showed you a different way to do it, and you get the same answer.
44:47
And I don't care about the book because as far as I'm concerned, they're smoking something.
44:51
Okay. On this, I would never do it this way the way they do it. But you do they get the same answer, don't you?
44:56
If you do it their way. I like my way better, obviously. Okay.
45:01
Okay, good. Now you come over and you look at these two.
45:05
Okay. And he's saying, well, look, I run the the factory.
45:11
And, you know, the fact that I use too much quantity wasn't the fact that I'm not a good manager of the equipment and the equipment
45:16
breaking down and we're having all kinds of problems and they destroy the equipment is not operating right.
45:23
So it destroys a bunch of good product and blah, blah, blah. It's not my fault.
45:29
It's your fault because you buy cheap materials. And what did she say?
45:33
It's your. Scheduling makes me rush orders at a higher price.
45:38
So that doesn't really explain it, because.
45:42
So we might say, Hey, Mary, your explanation isn't making sense with the facts here because you're actually getting a better price.
45:45
So what are you talking about? But let's say she's saying, Well, hey, I got a good price.
45:51
What do you want from me? That's my job, right? Meanwhile, he's saying, well, it's cheap.
45:55
Materials are causing the problem. So you've got two different parts of your operation sort of pointing the finger at each other here, don't you?
45:59
So what would you do? And everybody says, Bah, all of them.
46:06
I know that. Okay. Then what do you do? Have you fire both of them?
46:12
Then what do you do? So let's say you're not going to fire them.
46:15
What are you going to do? What would you do there?
46:18
You got this problem. Hey, you know, I don't want this.
46:23
$50 is worse than 21, so you might tell.
46:27
Mary see him? Say she's. Mary. He's. He's.
46:33
Joe. Huh? You might tell her to buy the regular, like, materials because we're losing money buying the cheap one right now or whatever.
46:37
Tell her. Yeah. I mean, yes. Okay. Yes. You might tell her something like Mary.
46:46
Spend whatever you need to on the materials.
46:52
Go for it. Knock yourself out. Get materials that ain't going to break no matter what we do.
46:56
That and what? Well, don't worry about it.
47:02
We're not going to kill you if you spend a little bit more than what we are budgeting for.
47:05
In fact, let's put that into the budget and spend a little more on the materials.
47:09
So we go ahead and we do that, and let's say we still end up with that lousy quantity variance.
47:13
Now, let's is excuse. So we start to work.
47:19
Okay. We're having some problems.
47:26
The material, the machinery is crushing the materials.
47:29
We got the finest in materials. What's our maintenance on our equipment?
47:32
Are we making sure that we're changing the sprockets in those machines on a regular basis?
47:37
Because, you know, it says here that if you don't change the sprockets, it will crush the material.
47:42
And that seems to be what's happening. Let's go change the sprockets.
47:47
We change the sprockets that what? That quantity variance goes away.
47:51
Now we start saying to Mary, hey, you know what? Back off on that expensive material because.
47:56
We think we got eye. We can run our operation a little better, go back to them.
48:06
Cheaper materials. All of a sudden what we see our profitability amounts going up because we're finding a nice rhythm to our operations right now.
48:10
This is that sort of circle thing that pointed you before.
48:22
Once you start to break down what's causing the differences like this, it gets you in a position,
48:26
you know, where you can start to make some continuous improvements in the operation.
48:32
Now, maybe where this is going to come to be relevant to you necessarily might be
48:36
somebody starts hammering you over the head with you're not meeting about it.
48:46
You know, you might start to look at some of this and saying, well, what's causing the difference?
48:50
Is it price or is it quantity or what's going on?
48:54
And then somebody starts saying, What are you talking about? We give you a little the way to defend yourself, right?
48:58
Okay, good. Now you come over and you would do this same thing for labor.
49:06
Now, with labor, we don't call it price, we call it rate.
49:12
And we don't call it quantity, we call it efficiency.
49:18
But it's essentially the same sort of thing. Okay.
49:22
So they tell us here in this one for the rate variance, I'll do first.
49:26
So we have what we have are actual hours and we multiply that by the standard rate.
49:32
I always put standard first in the parentheses. Standard rate minus what.
49:46
The actual rate. Okay.
49:53
And when we look at that, it's on the parentheses.
49:58
When we look at that, they say that they used how many hours?
50:01
25. Good. They use 2500 hours.
50:06
The standard rate was supposed to be, what, $10 to $10 per hour?
50:18
And it's like, hey, you know, how about if we pay our people a decent wage?
50:25
Maybe that would help, but we take that one $10 per hour.
50:28
And what was the actual rate per hour? Well, they spent a total of $26,250, and they incurred actual hours here of what, 2500?
50:33
That means that the actual rate was, what, ten, ten, 15, 50, 1050.
50:53
Okay. So we've got what we've got 2500 times.
51:00
That's a -50, 2500 times.
51:05
Negative point five is -$1,250.
51:09
If it's negative, it is unfavorable OC negative as well unfavorable oc OC good.
51:17
Then we come over and we do.
51:27
If that's my rate variance here, I'll do my efficiency variance, which is going to be my what my standard rate and I'm going to take my what?
51:33
My standard what is it, standard hours.
51:52
Minus my actual hours. Okay.
52:01
And my standard rate is, what, $10?
52:08
My standard hours over my actual hours? Let's start with that 2500.
52:13
And it tells me here that per tooth out per park, I made 2000 park.
52:20
And per park I'm supposed to spend, what, 1.2 hours?
52:27
So I take that 2000 times. 1.2 that comes out to, what, 2400 now?
52:32
Right. So I have what? I have $10 times a negative what 100 gives me.
52:41
What negative -1000?
52:50
If it's negative, it's unfavorable. Now, it shouldn't be surprising to me that both my what price and efficiency variance for labor go hand in hand.
52:53
Because if you're spending too much time, what are you probably doing? They spend too much time your time making this.
53:06
You're spending too much time. What he probably doing.
53:19
That's when your boss is coming up to you and say, do you mind if you work a little overtime today?
53:22
And that's when you're saying, I can't.
53:29
Why not? Because I want to go home.
53:33
Okay, good. So those tend to go hand in hand.
53:38
That's the proof. Those tend to go hand in hand.
53:42
And, you know, again, you get the blame game going where he's saying, oh, you're cheap materials.
53:45
We are bringing in that I think are moral. And she's saying, well, your poor scheduling and cramming mean whatever.
53:50
She should have used that excuse on the previous one. She flipped her excuses.
53:57
She should have used this excuse for the materials problem and use.
54:03
The other excuse was scheduling put.
54:08
Bottom line, we can start to squeeze these folks to understand, well, look, you know, hey, you know, more expensive material.
54:14
Don't worry about it. He's still spending all this time. What's going on?
54:21
Turns out he's got people smoking pot in the bathroom.
54:24
Question. Okay, good.
54:33
I'm not going to go into the overhead. Okay. Same thing.
54:40
I mean, it starts to become, you know, a machination of numbers here.
54:44
But what I do want, you understand, is that we focus more when we talk about overhead.
54:48
Remember, overhead tends to have fixed components like our depreciation and stuff.
54:54
And when we focus on overhead variances, typically we will focus on the variable part of those variances.
54:59
Because fixed is fixed. I mean, there shouldn't be much of a variance in depreciation, right?
55:06
And if there is, we probably can pretty quickly say, well, the reason is we bought new equipment.
55:11
You know, it doesn't take a whole lot of rocket science to figure out why you have variances in your fixed cost.
55:18
Right. Okay.
55:23
Question. Okay.
55:29
Excellent. So that gets us through chapter, whatever, on variance analysis.
55:34
So with that, let's turn our attention to capital budgeting.
55:42
And so what we really as you could probably tell from the.
55:54
So could you say from the beginning how well. Okay, so what you can probably tell from the discussion is we were talking about an operating budget.
56:07
We were talking about a budget that probably spends one year, maybe even quarterly, depending on how frequently we want to do that.
56:15
But really, we're talking about a maximum one year of time that we're thinking about when we're doing this budgeting.
56:23
Capital budgeting is a little different. And the capital budgeting says, well, instead of just looking at one year's worth of operation,
56:30
we're going to be looking at budgetary decisions, business decisions that will be being made that affects several years.
56:38
Now, the big point here is that we are going to have to consider time value of money then,
56:46
because as you start to consider money that's going across more than the current period, we have to start doing something called discounting.
56:52
We'll take a look at that process a little bit. So obviously you can see here we're talking about longer term type decisions, right?
56:58
Buying equipment versus leasing it. When should we do repairs?
57:08
What should we do to reduce some of our costs by having more efficient equipment, etc.?
57:12
Now, there are two kinds of decisions that we're going to look at here.
57:18
One is a screening decision. Screening decision is a yes or no answer.
57:23
We are going to make this investment. We are not going to make this investment.
57:28
Screening says what says or should say, preference decision says what?
57:33
We have a list of potential investments and we're going to rank those and decide which ones we want to make over others.
57:38
Right. So sometimes you may combine these two things.
57:45
You'll say, well, we're not going to do these. We have 20 different things we're considering.
57:49
We decided we're not going to do five of them, but we're left with what how much to say to 20?
57:53
We we're not going to do five, but we have 15 things left we want to do.
58:00
How will we rank these 15 things until we run out of investable capital?
58:04
Right. Okay. Now, this is the corporation again.
58:08
Don't forget where we are, guys. We're not talking about decisions that are made by external analysts.
58:11
These are what internal decisions, right. That are being made by the management of the entity.
58:16
Okay. Now, there are a lot of different analysis tools.
58:21
We're going to talk about three common ones, payback, net present value, and then something called the internal rate of return.
58:25
Okay. Now, when we think about these investments, we think in terms of cash inflows,
58:34
when you're deciding to make an investment, are you hoping to have a cash inflow from that investment?
58:41
Definitely. But you also have to think about what what are the cash outflows associated with that inflows?
58:47
Obviously, what additional revenue potential reduction of cost, salvage value.
58:55
We can sell this property for some amount when we're done.
59:02
Can you come over outflows?
59:06
Obviously, the initial investment that we're deciding, do we even want to do this?
59:09
But you have repairs and maintenance. Maybe there's some additional costs associated with this.
59:13
And notice on both slide, you had, what, a working capital release and a working capital use.
59:18
What's what are they talking about there? You know, just sort of a made up example.
59:28
Let's say we're going to be involved in some project and we have to have certain quantities of oil on hand at any point in time.
59:34
And we're going to be dealing with this equipment. And they say, well, you have to make sure and let's say we're just leasing the equipment.
59:43
And they say, well, you got to lease the equipment and then you're going to sit here and you're going
59:50
to have to maintain and you're going to have to have these containers of oil.
59:54
And so we require that you give us a deposit for the containers of oil,
59:58
and you we're going to hold that deposit until you give us the containers back.
1:00:03
When you give us the containers back, we'll give you the $100,000 and I'll make it that number of deposit back.
1:00:08
So what happens at the beginning of the project?
1:00:13
You'll have this. What, there's $100,000 of working capital.
1:00:17
Just think of it as cash.
1:00:22
Right now you have this hundred thousand dollars of working capital that'll go out at the beginning when the project is done.
1:00:23
That money comes back, doesn't it?
1:00:29
And so you consider it a cash inflow, although for all of these numbers we're going to in order to be able to compare apples to apples,
1:00:32
we're going to have to use what present value calculation so we can compare money maybe going out now
1:00:39
versus money that's going to be coming back five years from now or whatever the term of the project is.
1:00:46
Again, we're talking about longer term projects. Thus, we have to consider time value of money, time value of money.
1:00:50
And I usually have to struggle more to just explain this not to my Stanford students, but some of my other students.
1:00:58
They don't, for some reason don't seem to understand that if I what if I sit there and I have to wait longer for money, it's not worth as much to me.
1:01:06
If I have the money now, it's worth more to me than money that I have to wait for crime.
1:01:19
That's why people like to borrow money, right? And pay interest to borrow the money because you get to use it now.
1:01:26
You get to do whatever your business opportunity is now versus wait.
1:01:32
You get to have the car now versus wait. That's the whole idea of time, value, money.
1:01:36
So we'll see how those play out mathematically here in a couple of seconds.
1:01:41
Now, let's first use the payback period.
1:01:46
In payback period, we're going to look at advantages and disadvantages of the different methods.
1:01:49
We're talking about payback, net present value, internal rate of return here in a minute.
1:01:53
But I'm telling you right now, payback is a very rudimentary basic screening tool that you might use to decide,
1:01:57
first off, what you're going to keep and not keep.
1:02:08
And then you'll probably supplement it with one of the other forms that we're talking about.
1:02:11
By the way, just so I don't forget, net present value is probably the most widely accepted way of making these analysis versus these others.
1:02:16
But net present value is very basic and all we do is say, what is the investment that we are thinking about making?
1:02:27
What do we think will be the annual net cash inflows that are generated by this investment?
1:02:36
And thus, how long will it take us to recoup this initial investment?
1:02:42
Okay, now you come over and they tell us, well, the cost is 140,000.
1:02:48
The project has a ten year life will generate net annual cash inflows.
1:02:53
That's the outflows versus the inflows better generate a positive inflow or you know,
1:02:58
don't do it net positive inflow and management has a payback period as an initial screening of five years.
1:03:05
And so they got this espresso bar or whatever.
1:03:13
And so they take the 140,000, the initial investment divided by the amount of the net annual cash inflows,
1:03:17
it's going to take them four years to recoup this.
1:03:24
So they say, okay, in this particular case,
1:03:27
we'll do it because it's meeting that minimum or maybe a minimum of a maximum maximum period of time that they're willing to wait to collect.
1:03:32
That investment was four years. So they'll go ahead and they'll do it now.
1:03:40
Maybe they'll go forward and they'll say, okay, now let's apply net present value,
1:03:45
because we know that at least this is meeting this very basic hurdle. Okay, now I keep getting how much?
1:03:50
So I get these guys knock on the door, do you want to buy solar panels?
1:04:01
And I'm like, okay, come on in. What's it all about?
1:04:08
You know? And then they tell me and after you do this and they are not using present value calculations on that,
1:04:11
by the way, it'll only take you 25 years to recoup your investment.
1:04:17
I'm like, So when I'm dead, so do you.
1:04:24
To get this, I'm going to start saving money. When they put me in the nursing home for hey, for getting this for me.
1:04:27
Not so much. Maybe for somebody else. Okay, it makes sense then.
1:04:33
They're well. Well, what about the polar bears? Okay, so, you know, then I got into this thing lately where I go and I like to sing karaoke.
1:04:37
For some reason, I don't know how I got into this, you know?
1:04:45
So then this guy comes up to me and he's like, Man, you're really good.
1:04:48
You're really good. You know, I want you to come and sing in my band.
1:04:52
You want to come and sing in my band? Well, okay, I'll come over. Yeah, what the heck?
1:04:56
I'll come over. G The guy likes my singing, right? By the way, would you like to buy some solar panels from me?
1:04:59
Okay, so, you know, I'm all getting hit up for solar panels or whatever.
1:05:06
Okay, so it's. So anyway, note to self.
1:05:09
Leave that part of the story. It really depends on what it really depends on the question of, you know, how,
1:05:15
what are the objectives of the company and maybe you then what supplement this with another
1:05:23
method of analysis now so the shortcomings are what it ignores time value of money,
1:05:28
in fact, not the singing solar panel, but the other guy.
1:05:36
I told my buddy, Oh, I got to go.
1:05:40
I can't hang out with you guys because I got to go home because I got a solar panel guy coming to come in to meet me.
1:05:42
He's going to come back because I tell him, come back and bring more information.
1:05:49
And I told him, what's funny is after he gets here, I'm going to start running present value calculations on him.
1:05:52
And then the guy, my buddy starts laughing, it starts cracking up.
1:05:57
I said, No, really? He says, Yeah, I know. That's why I'm laughing.
1:06:01
I know you're going to really do this to this poor guy. So anyway, some of the short backs are and it ignores cash flows after the payback period.
1:06:04
We're in there. I don't want this investment because it's not going to pay me back in four years.
1:06:12
Meanwhile, in year five. Up a Brink's truck to your door in the amount that you're going to be earning.
1:06:16
So, you know, that has that shortcoming. The probably easy thing is it's an upfront, easy screening tool right now.
1:06:23
One of the things that they say, the disadvantage, what if your cash flows are uneven,
1:06:33
then what do you do like that presents some sort of, you know, calculation hurdle that couldn't be overcome easily enough?
1:06:38
We'll just figure out when are the cash flows going to come in and see how long
1:06:47
it'll take you to get whatever it is that you're saying you need to recoup.
1:06:50
If they had a 4000 and they'd get 1000 the first year and then the second year, 2000, that 3000 by the fourth year I got the 4000.
1:06:54
It meets the requirements of five years. We're done. That's not that typical.
1:07:01
Okay. All right, good. Now, as I've said, probably the most widely accepted that you hear a lot is net present value.
1:07:07
And sometimes I see discussion of net present value and then I ask somebody, is cash an asset?
1:07:17
And they say, Yeah, I'm using net present value calculation says cash an asset, and they say no.
1:07:24
So I mean, you know, it's easy to talk about net present value is another thing to actually understand what it's doing.
1:07:29
And so what we're going to do is sit here and we're going to accept a project if it has a positive net present value or zero net present value,
1:07:36
which only happens in textbooks. And if it has a negative net present value, we will not do this project.
1:07:48
What a positive net present value is. Telling you is you are getting the required rate of return on this.
1:07:55
An equal zero net present value tells you that you are getting the required rate of return.
1:08:02
Negative says you're not getting whatever the rate of return was that you wanted on this.
1:08:07
So we're going to have to use a discount rate and that will allow us to discount these cash flows to present value.
1:08:13
Now, sometimes probably, you know, the hardest part of this is, well, where is the discount rate coming from?
1:08:21
The account I'm trying to underline and it looks like it's going to make me looks like it's going to fight me.
1:08:27
And if it is, I'm not going to do anything then because the drawing isn't that important here.
1:08:33
Okay. The hard part is what is the discount rate?
1:08:38
Well, where does that come from? And we're not going to get into that because this is not a finite finance class.
1:08:42
Okay. But just to quickly give you a sense of the kinds of things that would go into it,
1:08:47
there is something called the weighted average cost of capital is often considered a way
1:08:53
of coming up with a discount rate and what the weighted average cost of capital says.
1:08:59
Well, what's your cost of your borrowing? And the cost of borrowing is generally calculated by taking the risk free rate of return.
1:09:04
How do they where do they come up with the risk free rate of return? It's like the yield on the ten year bond, the yield on Treasury stock,
1:09:15
because they're saying that the federal government doesn't default on its debt, does it?
1:09:22
Not yet. Not yet. But go ahead.
1:09:29
In June, if they default on their debt, stay out of Hayward.
1:09:35
It's going to be bad. Okay. All I'm telling you is the federal government cannot default on its debt.
1:09:41
If you hear somebody that says, hey, the federal government, it's okay if the federal government defaults on their debt.
1:09:47
Here's what you do. All you know, when you go to the doctor and they put that thing in your eye to see if you know something is going on,
1:09:54
to see if there's anybody back there because it probably got taken over by the body snatchers.
1:10:01
Okay. All right. So just the government can default on its debt at a minimum.
1:10:06
If the federal government defaults on their debt, they'll have to refinance. They'll have to refinance.
1:10:11
They have to rewrite all the finance textbooks so they take the risk free rate of return,
1:10:15
and then they go ahead and they start adding a premium on for the company based on whatever sort of factors they have,
1:10:22
risk factors, etc., that they have. That's the cost of debt.
1:10:29
The cost of a lot of capital. And they start to take a look at, well, what is the cost of retained earnings?
1:10:34
And they can use something called the capital asset pricing model to figure out what is the cost of capital.
1:10:41
And so they go ahead and they go when they wait those appropriately, I'm going to do 60% debt on this,
1:10:46
40% equity on this investment, and that spits out what the cost of capital is.
1:10:53
And then they may add a what a profitability index on top of that.
1:11:02
And that's then the number that they'll use as to whether or not they want to decide to do this investment or not.
1:11:07
That's where this discount rate comes from. Now, in this example, they're talking about buying some sort of equipment.
1:11:13
I don't know what it is that they're buying some sort of what is it, car washing equipment or something?
1:11:22
I don't know what it is, but they're sitting here and they're saying, well, we have the cost of the capital, the working capital that's required.
1:11:27
That's that working capital, working capital tie up.
1:11:35
We're going to realign the equipment in three years. We can sell it in five years for 5000.
1:11:40
And here's the amount to come in. We're going to have sales, but we have to buy the parts.
1:11:45
We have to pay salaries. So we're going to have a net cash inflow here of 80,000.
1:11:50
But we have the problem here, guys, of what we've got different amounts of cash coming in at different times.
1:11:57
The equipment cost is going out now. The working capital is going out now.
1:12:04
The working capital is returning later. This 80,000 is going to be coming in well over a series of years.
1:12:07
So what we do to get to the present value of that is we use discount factors now for amounts that are going out.
1:12:14
Now the factor is one because those are going out.
1:12:22
Now, the problem is what is the present value of these amounts that are going to go out or come in at these future times?
1:12:26
Now you can see that they use various factors here.
1:12:35
And the thing that you want to observe from this is that these numbers come from a couple of different and I like to talk about tables.
1:12:39
I know there's present value calculators, but I like to use the tables because it kind of helps to illustrate what's going on here.
1:12:50
And so this thing was what what was the term of this project?
1:12:58
Five years. Five years, right? Yeah.
1:13:03
And the cash flow was the discount factor was 11 was 11%.
1:13:07
And you see how they have these factors for the salvage value, which is going to come in later, the relining of the equipment which will come later.
1:13:15
And they use these factors which the number is less than one. So five, let's just do five years at 11%.
1:13:23
So you come over here, you go to five years, you scroll over to 11%, and you come up with this factor point five, nine, three, four or five.
1:13:31
And every table has a little different in this particular example on the slide, they didn't carry it out that far.
1:13:43
But you can see that the numbers are substantially the same, right.
1:13:51
Now, when you're talking about a one time payment and you look at that present value table,
1:13:56
notice what all the numbers are less than one and the numbers should all be less than one because we know that
1:14:02
an amount that's going to not come in later is not worth as much to us as an amount that we could have now.
1:14:10
Right. So all the numbers on that present value and it's called a present value of a dollar because it's what it is, one single payment.
1:14:16
It's just one payment that's going to be made. And so they call that present value of a dollar.
1:14:27
Now present value of annuity, which by the way, these are on canvas.
1:14:32
Present value of annuity says, hey, it's not one payment.
1:14:38
It's several payments. Okay.
1:14:41
And I've heard people talking. I've had friends saying I need to marry an annuity baby.
1:14:45
And I'm just like, okay, whatever. I mean, make your own money, okay? But whatever.
1:14:49
We're sitting here and we have what? Annuity means that there's money that's going to be coming in year over, year over year.
1:14:53
And so when we take a look at that, we need to use that factor.
1:15:00
When you look at the back at the slide here, we need to use that kind of a factor for what?
1:15:06
For the 80,000, because that's going to be five years.
1:15:13
So now you go, what now? And it was 11%, right?
1:15:17
So now you go to the five year period, you come over to 11%.
1:15:21
And there you find that number that we saw on the slide there, which is that three six, nine five.
1:15:27
So notice here on the annuity factors, what all the numbers are greater than one.
1:15:35
And they should be greater than one because it is worth more than one payment, isn't it?
1:15:43
Now, the only role where the numbers are not greater than one is in the one payment row.
1:15:50
And I'm here to tell you that if it's one payment, it's not an annuity.
1:15:56
So when I run for president, I'm going to run on the platform that when I'm president,
1:16:00
all president value of an annuity tables will have the one payment Roe blocked out because it's not an annuity.
1:16:05
All the other numbers are what are greater than one, but notice they're greater than one, but less than whatever row they're on.
1:16:14
Because again, the what the present value is going to be less than if you had the money right now today.
1:16:23
So we know we have to make it less than what however it would be if you multiply it by two.
1:16:31
Right. Okay. All right. So just a basic understanding of how this time value of money thing is working.
1:16:34
But we go ahead and from current slide, I believe.
1:16:42
Okay. And when we look at this notice, when we discount the cash flows, it comes out positive, doesn't it?
1:16:49
And we've said that if a project has a proposed positive net present value, you should go ahead and accept the project, right?
1:16:56
Or zero, which the present value only comes out as net present value that comes out to zero and textbooks.
1:17:03
But that's telling you you're getting exactly that return, right?
1:17:10
The 11% return, those that are less and we're probably not going to do or we said you could use it as a preference tool.
1:17:13
Maybe I've got what maybe I've got five projects I'm considering.
1:17:21
I only have enough capital to maybe do not all five of them.
1:17:26
So I'll go ahead. And now what? I'll rank them in order with the largest net present value first and the second and the third, etc.
1:17:30
And of course this is just considering the net present value outcome. There could be other things that feed into other strategic objectives of the
1:17:37
company that might cause certain projects to move up for whatever reasons.
1:17:44
Right? Okay.
1:17:48
Okay, good. Now we've discussed what we just said.
1:17:53
Okay, now you come over and we could use internal rate of return.
1:17:56
And what the internal rate of return says is we are going to figure out what the retained rate of return of this project is,
1:18:01
and we'll figure that out by figuring out what rate of return causes the net present value to be zero.
1:18:09
We will then compare that to some sort of internal hurdle rate that the company has come up with.
1:18:16
Maybe it's based on the weighted average cost of capital, whatever, and we will accept or reject a project accordingly that way.
1:18:22
So we go ahead and that's what this slide is saying a little behind on advancing my slides and what I'm saying.
1:18:31
But let's look at this particular example.
1:18:38
Okay. Now, sometimes I like to just sort of say, well, where did they get this formula from?
1:18:41
Okay. And we're saying, hey, zero has to equal what has to equal the initial investment.
1:18:53
Okay? The initial investment has the equals zero, the net present value of this project.
1:19:09
So what I'm trying to say has to equal the initial investment times, some factor, some present value factor.
1:19:21
I mean, that's essentially what they're saying to you is that the net present value of this project has to equal what and the initial investment time,
1:19:32
some sort of factor. Now that initial investment, then what we're going to do is say, well, if we take the initial investment, I'm doing this wrong.
1:19:39
The initial investment is what I'm trying to say is has to equal the net cash flows,
1:20:00
times some present value factor and that present value factor has to be equal to whatever my hurdle rate is.
1:20:14
And it turns out that if you make this what if you make this net present value zero, that will achieve that particular return on that investment.
1:20:22
So then they go ahead and they divide each side by the net cash flows and that's going to give them the present value factor.
1:20:33
Right. And then you'll look up that present value factor and you'll look it up on you
1:20:44
can look it up on a table or you can use a financial calculator or whatever.
1:20:51
And that will then tell you if you're getting the required rate of return on this.
1:20:54
So that's what they did in this particular example, they said, well, we have an initial investment of 140,000 A320 annual cash flows or 20,000.
1:20:59
They do the math on that. They get the factor. Now they go to the present value of the annuity factor.
1:21:09
And since this project was going to go on for ten years, they run their finger along until they find the factor that came up.
1:21:15
And then they go up the row. And this analysis is telling them that they're going to get a 14% return on this project.
1:21:23
Now, only in textbooks does it come out to what exactly?
1:21:31
Whatever the factor was, sometimes you'll have an amount that's between two factors, but you can still figure it out.
1:21:36
What you do is you look at what's the difference between the two factors.
1:21:43
You take that difference and then you divide that by the lower factor for the lower interest rate
1:21:46
that then what gives you the percentage difference between the higher number and the lower number,
1:21:54
and you just add that percentage on to the lower number and that gives you a better look at
1:21:59
what their return is because they generally don't fall right on a percentage like this did.
1:22:04
So this is telling you, hey, 14% will cause a net present value of this project to be zero.
1:22:10
You will get this return of 14% management.
1:22:16
Are you happy with that? And if management say, well, now we've got projects that are going to return 17, 18%.
1:22:20
So no to this one, we have a weighted average cost of capital that's more than 14%.
1:22:25
There is no way we can accept this project, etc. Okay.
1:22:30
Now some problems with the internal rate of return approach.
1:22:36
I'm not going to expand it. I'm going to get ready to end this thing in a second.
1:22:43
But since I don't have this slide that talks about problems,
1:22:47
problems with the internal rate of return over why it's less acceptable in net present value, why not presume that this thing assumed what?
1:22:50
Assumed that the cash flows were all the same, didn't it? I mean, is that typically how things work?
1:22:59
The cash flows just come in all one same cash flow, this whatever it was, this, 20,000.
1:23:06
No cash flows tend to vary for various reasons. Net present value was you saw in the previous example deals pretty well with different cash flows,
1:23:11
amounts coming in and going out at different times, as opposed to just this idea of the steady stream of cash flows.
1:23:20
That's probably the main problem with internal rate of return and y net present value tends to be more widely accepted.
1:23:26
Okay. Question. Question.
1:23:34
Okay. So here's what's going to happen. We are scheduled for class on Wednesday.
1:23:46
I am not going to hold class on Wednesday.
1:23:52
I'm going to give you that as a free work day to be able to finish your guest speaker, write up your financial analysis, financial statement analysis.
1:23:56
Right up to both of those are due on Friday.
1:24:10
So I hope you're not starting it on Wednesday and you should be able to be done with that.
1:24:16
But you can put any finishing touches on that, make sure it is submitted by 1159 on Saint Patrick's Day.
1:24:22
Okay. So if you're planning to go on, you know, be dancing on Saint Patrick's Day, make sure you turn in your project first, right?
1:24:28
Because 1159 we're cutting you off.
1:24:37
11:59 p.m. And if you have any outstanding write ups because you miss class and you still want to get those attendance points,
1:24:39
those also have to be in by 1159 on March 17th, this coming Friday.
1:24:47
All right, guys, good luck. We'll see you.
1:24:54
